# AmazonApiGatewaySigV4AwsSdkPHP
This is a small sample application in php for fetching results from Amazon API Gateway using the AWS SDK for PHP. This script uses Signature v4 authentication (IAM user) in combination with an api token from Amazon API gateway. In the default setup of this script, it uses a JSON payload as the body over the POST method and generates all the required headers.
